# HRConnect

HRConnect is a robust Employee Management System designed to streamline employee and task management processes. Built using modern web technologies, HRConnect incorporates role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure and efficient handling of organizational operations.

---

## Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
HRConnect supports three primary roles, each with distinct permissions:

1. **Admin**:
   - Create user roles.
   - Add new roles.
   - Assign roles to employees (HR, Manager, Employee).

2. **HR (Human Resources)**:
   - **Create Employee Record**: Add new employees to the system.
   - **Read Employee Information**: View and search through employee profiles and records.

3. **Manager**:
   - **Assign Tasks**: Assign tasks to team members with deadlines and priorities.
   - **Read Employee Performance**: View available employees and their performance data.
   - **Update Task Status**: Change the status of tasks (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed").
   - **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the system.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Next.js
- **Backend**: Nest.js
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) with Bearer Token for route protection
- **Database**: [Specify database used, e.g., PostgreSQL/MongoDB]
- **Styling**: [Specify styling library if applicable, e.g., Tailwind CSS/Material UI]

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hrconnect.git
   cd hrconnect
   ```

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directories of both the frontend and backend.
   - Define the following variables:
     ```env
     # Frontend
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

     # Backend
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   # Run backend
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev

   # Run frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Future Enhancements
- Implement detailed employee performance tracking and analytics.
- Add notifications for task assignments and updates.
- Integrate with external payroll systems.
- Enhance UI/UX for a more seamless experience.
